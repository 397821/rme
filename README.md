Installation instructions
=========================

Windows
=======
If you have an up-to-date version of windows, you should be able to run the program right off the bat.

If you don't have them already, you will need the following dll files:
*iconv.dll
*libxml2.dll
*msvcp100.dll (SP1)
*msvcr100.dll (SP1)
*zlib1.dll
*archive.dll

Download them (google the filenames) and put them in the same folder as the RME.exe file.

If the mapeditor still won't load, you will need to install the NET 2.0 framework (only relevant for Windows XP).
